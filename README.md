### Raw Tables
| Table | Rows (seed) | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| trips_raw | 15 | All ride records |
| drivers_raw | 8 | Driver profiles |
| riders_raw | 10 | Rider profiles |
| payments_raw | 14 | Payment transactions |
| cities_raw | 5 | Operating cities |
| driver_status_events_raw | 20 | High-volume driver events |

---

## 🏗️ Layered Architecture

### Staging Layer
- One model per source table
- Renames columns to snake_case
- Casts correct data types
- Deduplicates using primary keys
- Standardizes timestamps
- Removes null primary keys
- `stg_driver_status_events` uses **incremental** materialization (high volume)

### Intermediate Layer
- Ephemeral models — embedded into downstream queries
- `int_trips_enriched` — trip duration, net revenue, fraud flags
- `int_driver_metrics` — lifetime trips, revenue, churn detection
- `int_rider_metrics` — LTV, segment classification
- `int_payment_analysis` — failed payments, amount mismatches

### Marts Layer
- Star schema: fact + dimension tables
- `fct_trips` — partitioned by date, clustered by city + driver
- `fct_payments` — all payment attempts including failures
- `dim_drivers` — enriched with tier, churn, city info
- `dim_riders` — enriched with LTV segment, payment preferences

---

## 📸 Incremental Models

### Why Incremental?
`fct_trips` and `stg_driver_status_events` use incremental materialization because:
- Trip data grows daily — full refresh scans entire history unnecessarily
- `driver_status_events_raw` is a **high volume** append-only table
- Incremental reduces BigQuery costs and improves run time

### Full Refresh vs Incremental

| | Full Refresh | Incremental |
|--|--|--|
| **Cost** | High (scans all data) | Low (new rows only) |
| **Speed** | Slow at scale | Fast |
| **Simplicity** | Simple | Requires watermark logic |
| **Risk** | Safe — rebuilds cleanly | Late-arriving data may be missed |
| **Use when** | Schema changes, backfills | Daily production runs |

---

## 🔍 Data Quality

### Generic Tests (64 total)
- `not_null` on all primary keys
- `unique` on all primary keys
- `accepted_values` on all status/enum columns
- `relationships` between fact and dimension tables

### Custom Tests (3)
| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `assert_no_negative_revenue` | No completed trip has negative fare |
| `assert_trip_duration_positive` | Completed trips have duration > 0 |
| `assert_completed_trip_has_payment` | Every completed trip has a successful payment |

### Freshness Tests
- `trips_raw`: warn after 1 hour, error after 2 hours
- `driver_status_events_raw`: warn after 30 mins, error after 1 hour

---

## 📸 Snapshots (SCD Type 2)

`drivers_snapshot` tracks historical changes to:
- `driver_status` (active → suspended → inactive)
- `vehicle_id` (vehicle reassignments)
- `driver_rating` (rating updates)

Uses `check` strategy on BigQuery for type compatibility.

---

## 🚨 Fraud Detection Logic

| Indicator | Logic |
|-----------|-------|
| Extreme surge | `surge_multiplier > 10` |
| Duplicate payment | Same trip has >1 successful payment |
| Failed payment on completed trip | Trip completed but no successful payment recorded |
| Amount mismatch | Payment amount differs from actual fare by >£1 |

---

## 📈 Supported Analytics Use Cases

| Use Case | Model |
|----------|-------|
| Daily revenue per city | `fct_trips` |
| Gross vs net revenue | `fct_trips` |
| Corporate vs personal split | `fct_trips` |
| Top drivers by revenue | `dim_drivers` |
| Driver activity monitoring | `dim_drivers` + `stg_driver_status_events` |
| Rider lifetime value | `dim_riders` |
| Payment failure rate | `fct_payments` |
| Surge impact analysis | `fct_trips` |
| Driver churn tracking | `dim_drivers` |
| Fraud detection insights | `fct_trips` |

## ⚙️ Airbyte Ingestion

See [docs/airbyte/airbyte_config.md](docs/airbyte/airbyte_config.md) for full configuration.

**Source:** PostgreSQL on Supabase (aws-1-eu-west-1.pooler.supabase.com)
**Destination:** BigQuery dataset `beejanride_raw`
**Sync Mode:** Full Refresh / Overwrite (Incremental / Append for events)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install dbt-bigquery

# Authenticate
gcloud auth application-default login

# Install dbt packages
dbt deps

# Load seed data
dbt seed

# Run all models
dbt build

# Generate docs
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Connect Airbyte to real PostgreSQL source and replace seed data
- Add dbt Exposures for dashboard dependencies
- Implement dbt metrics layer for standardised KPIs
- Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for automated testing
- Add row-count monitoring with `dbt_utils.equal_rowcount`
- Expand fraud detection with ML anomaly scoring
- Add `dim_vehicles` and `dim_dates` for full star schema
